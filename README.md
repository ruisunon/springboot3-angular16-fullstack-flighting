# Flight Advisor ServiceFlight Advisor Service is a set of APIs for primarily finding the cheapest flight from city A toCity B is based on price, and as a result, it returns all the trip information alongside thedistance(s).## System Functionality## Getting started### Project Management### System components StructureLet's first explain the system layers structure to understand its components:```Flight-Advisor --> Parent folder. |- docs --> Contains system images.|- data --> Contains Airports and routes files.|- frontend --> Contains the frontend UI project.|- src/main/java - org.siriusxi.fa (package)  |- FlightAdvisorApplication.java --> The main starting point of the application.  |- api --> Contains All REST API controllers that receive requests from the client             to process that request and, finally, return appropriate responses.              It contains all request and response DTOs.  |- repository --> All the database entities CRUD management services.   |- domain --> Domain contains all the database-modeled entities.  |- infra --> Contains all the configurations, exceptions, security management,                support utilities, and dto <--> entities mappers for the system support.   |- service --> Contains all the system business login,                  receives calls from Controllers, calls the repository to retrieve and manage data,                  then processes them to return to the controllers. ```Now, as we have learned about different system layers and components, so it is time then toplay, let's play.
